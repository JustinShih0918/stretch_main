# `mf5_mapping_both` is `mf5_ascentnav_map` + `agent.osg_world_model=true`:
# ASCENT's control flow drives, and OSG's world model is fed the same frames,
# so one walk leaves BOTH the per-storey ObstacleMap stack and the schema-v2
# scene graph. The world model runs its own YOLOE head because ASCENT drives on
# closed-set D-FINE, which cannot see a cracker box.
#
# `ycb.obstacle_map_union=true` keeps EVERY episode's snapshot rather than the
# best one. That is the measured lever, not a preference: the protocol runs one
# mapping episode per authored target and the best-of rule discards the rest --
# on 00800 the union took lower-storey navmesh coverage from 0.51 to 0.81 and
# moved all 12 authored target positions to within 1.2 m of mapped free space,
# one of them from 5.1 m OUTSIDE. Pass 2 must then ALSO set
# `obstacle_map_union=true`, because union mode never writes `<scene>.json`.
#
# SEQUENTIAL ON PURPOSE. The five ASCENT model servers hold ~16 GB of the
# card and ollama's qwen2.5:7b another ~4.7 GB; two Habitat processes on top of
# that is how a night's work ends in a CUDA OOM.
#
# Never wait on a PID in this container: PID 1 is `conda run ... bash`, which is

# Episodes kept per scene. The protocol generates one per authored target (6-8),
# and the union of all of them was the right answer AT 500 STEPS, where a single
# episode could not cross a staircase and so mapped one storey: on 00800 the
# first snapshot covered 0.775/0.000 of the two storeys' navigable area and it
# took the second to reach 0.759 mean. At 1500 steps one episode crosses, and
# the FIRST snapshot measured 0.787/0.777 -- mean 0.782, already past the
# 3-episode 500-step union. The marginal episode there was worth +0.010 to
# +0.012, so the tail is paid for at roughly 13 minutes per point of coverage.
# MAX_EPISODES is that tail cut off; set it to -1 to keep every episode.
#
# 3, not 1, and not 6. One 1500-step episode already passes the gate that
# matters -- every authored target inside the mapped region -- but its worst
# target sat 1.46 m from mapped free space against a 1.5 m gate, which is no
# margin at all. Three is past where the 500-step curve flattened (+0.047 at
# the third episode, then +0.010, +0.012, +0.012) and costs ~38 min a scene
# against ~90. Raise it for a scene the audit fails; the resume check is
# count-aware, so re-running tops a scene up rather than skipping it.
