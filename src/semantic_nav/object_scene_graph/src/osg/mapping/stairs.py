"""Stair detection: where can the agent change storey?

Two signals, and the ordering between them is set by measurement rather than
preference. On the 100-episode v1 run the YOLOE `stairs` class fired in only
**15% of multi-floor episodes** (12 tracks / 100 episodes) -- high quality when
it fired (median score 0.60, median 26 observations) but far too sparse to
gate a floor transition on. So:

* **Geometry leads.** ZONDA's criterion: on a coarse grid, a cell is steppable
  when the largest height difference to its 8 neighbours is below the agent's
  climb limit. Flat floor gives ~0, a wall gives metres, a staircase sits in
  between at roughly its riser height. No model, no weights, works on any
  observed surface.
* **Semantics confirm.** A `stairs` track in the object layer raises confidence
  for cells near it, but is never required.

The output is deliberately conservative. Confirmed cells get written FREE in
the costmap and exempted from the obstacle stamp, and
`docs/history/INVESTIGATION.md` records that *every* previous attempt to soften the
costmap's obstacle writes (hit-count corroboration, speckle filtering) cost
more real geometry than it gained. So a cell must clear the geometric test AND
belong to a component large enough to be an actual staircase before it is
touched, and the total relabelled area is capped.
