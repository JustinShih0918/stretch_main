"""What becomes a navigation goal, and what does not.

This is where the dynamic-scene machinery decides. A track is proposable only if
it clears four gates, and the two interesting ones are the ones a static-map
system does not have:

  presence    `min_presence` (0.45) replaces blacklisting when an approach finds
              nothing. The track stays in the map, drops below the bar, and
              comes back if it is seen again -- no absorbing states. The value is
              set by arithmetic rather than taste: a belief reloaded from a prior
              map at 0.82 lands at 0.485 after one detector-strength absence
              reading and 0.36 after a VLM one, so ONE detector miss is not
              enough to retire a track and one VLM answer is decisive.

  identity    presence cannot answer "is it MINE". A false positive is an object
              that really is there, so every look that disproves it as the target
              also re-detects it as an object and pins its belief at the positive
              clamp. Measured with the identity channel off: one episode
              committed to the same wrong track 251 times in 500 steps. Two
              rejections retires it -- one arrival can end on a bad heading, two
              is a decision.

Ranking is `best_score * presence.p`, which is the whole query-side payoff of
the filter: a track the agent has looked for and not found sinks below one it
has not disproved, instead of being re-proposed on every replan.

The VLM candidate gate is here too, and it is OFF in the shipped config for a
measured reason: verifying a track's stored best crop accepts ~97% of the time,
because a distant chair-like object really does look like a chair. In the
ablation ladder it was the one change that HURT -- SR 0.385 -> 0.260 -- and of
the first three rejections in a pilot all three were correct candidates. When it
does reject, that is one piece of identity evidence, not a verdict.
