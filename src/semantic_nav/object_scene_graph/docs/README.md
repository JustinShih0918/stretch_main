# Documentation index

Two kinds of document live here. The **reference** set at this level describes the system as
it is: the paper, the architecture, how to set it up, run it, measure it, and put it on a
robot. Everything under [`history/`](history/) is the record of how it got here — experiment
logs, frozen result tables and superseded design notes, kept because the constants and numbers
of the reference set trace back to them. Being in `history/` is the label: read a file there as
true of its date, not of the current tree. The few that are wrong even as a record of their
date (superseded, never run) also say so at the top.

## Start here

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [PAPER.md](PAPER.md) | The ICRA 2027 submission in full, plus a paper→code map and a number→run provenance table. **The system is MD-SG in the paper and OSG in the code.** |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | The OSG pipeline module by module, the four belief mechanisms, why each constant is what it is, and the known limitations. |
| [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) | Clone with submodules, `docker/.env`, weights, the two conda envs. |
| [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) | How to run the pipeline, and what the default arm scores. |

## Measuring it

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) | How this repo measures ObjectNav, and every difference from native ASCENT. |
| [DYNAMIC_EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.md](DYNAMIC_EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.md) | The two-pass moved-object protocol: map the static layout, relocate, search from the stale snapshot. |
| [UNIFIED_PIPELINE.md](UNIFIED_PIPELINE.md) | One agent across the three datasets (DualMap's release, the five-scene multi-floor set, the fifteen authored scenes), and the paired run showing the floor group is inert on one storey. |
| [DUALMAP_OFFICIAL_RERUN.md](DUALMAP_OFFICIAL_RERUN.md) | DualMap re-run on its own released benchmark — the source of the 30.2 % cross-anchor figure the paper compares against — and what that benchmark can and cannot resolve. |
| [CROSS_ANCHOR_REPRODUCTION.md](CROSS_ANCHOR_REPRODUCTION.md) | Whether the paper's single-floor cross-anchor headline re-derives, what was ruled out, and the 2026-09-27 re-run on the original prior maps. **Read before quoting Table I.** |
| [ZERO_SHOT_AUDIT.md](ZERO_SHOT_AUDIT.md) | Every piece of hand-authored per-benchmark knowledge in the pipeline. |

## Figures and the video

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [FIGURES.md](FIGURES.md) | Every paper figure, its caption, its provenance and the renderer that regenerates it. |

## Running on a real robot

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [ROS2.md](ROS2.md) | The ROS 2 / Nav2 layer for the Stretch 3: why two interpreters, the frame conventions, who owns the base, the manual floor switch, the two-run protocol, and how to check all of it with no robot. |
| [THOR.md](THOR.md) | Where that layer runs: a Jetson AGX Thor beside the robot, two containers, and every knob that can only be settled on the device. |

## History — `history/`

Append-only measurements and the reasoning behind decisions. Large because they are complete.

**The logs, in order**

| doc | |
|---|---|
| [AB_RESULTS.md](history/AB_RESULTS.md) | 236 KB. Every staged change S0–S76 on the ObjectNav / ASCENT-parity line, its measured effect, the decision. |
| [DYNAMIC_SCENES.md](history/DYNAMIC_SCENES.md) | 161 KB. The dynamic-scene design and its experiment log. |
| [AUTHORED_BENCHMARK_LADDER.md](history/AUTHORED_BENCHMARK_LADDER.md) | Conditions A–U on the authored layouts, scored by the 2 m viewpoint rule — the measurements behind many of `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s constants. Moved out of it on 2026-10-15. |
| [DUALMAP_PROTOCOL_EARLY_ARMS.md](history/DUALMAP_PROTOCOL_EARLY_ARMS.md) | Our September arms on DualMap's 186 trials (37.6 % → the tight ring), before region-proposal fusion. Moved out of `DUALMAP_OFFICIAL_RERUN.md` on 2026-10-15. |
| [CROSS_ANCHOR_OBSTACLE_MAP.md](history/CROSS_ANCHOR_OBSTACLE_MAP.md) | Navigating a moved layout over ASCENT's obstacle map — every measurement and every wrong turn. Carries an internal retraction. |
| [CROSS_ANCHOR_STATUS.md](history/CROSS_ANCHOR_STATUS.md) | The summary of the above: where it stands, what was found by layer, what is left. |
| [OVERNIGHT_SR_ITERATION.md](history/OVERNIGHT_SR_ITERATION.md) | Written as it happened, on branch `experiment/sr-70-50`. |
| [SENSOR_V2_107.md](history/SENSOR_V2_107.md) | The `_sensor_v2` arm on the 107 dynamic trials. |

The scripts these documents ran, where they are no longer part of the release surface, are in
[`scripts/legacy/`](../scripts/legacy/README.md); the exploratory presets they name are in
[`configs/experiment/archive/`](../configs/experiment/archive/README.md) and compose as
`+experiment=archive/<name>`.
